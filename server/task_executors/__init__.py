"""
task_executors package

Contains the concrete implementations of the task_executor interface, i.e. the "types of tasks"
mentioned in the problem statement.

# I might be unable to implement (and test) all the functionality I had been planning
# to due to the time constraints, but it is fairly straightforward to add additional types
# of tasks. Just add the corresponding class and add it to the EXECUTOR_REGISTRY in utils.taskutils.py
